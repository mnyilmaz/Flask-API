# :hash: Purpose
<p align="justify">
Flask API is an API built on the Flask web framework, which serves as an interface for software applications to communicate. It receives and processes web requests, generating responses for specific URLs. APIs enable different systems or applications to share data, often providing data in formats like JSON. Flask API can be used in various fields, facilitating data exchange between applications. With Flask, the task at hand is to create a backend that allows our frontend to communicate with the Python application developed by the Chatbot team. This Flask application will handle GET and POST API requests, enabling the transmission of messages from the website to the chatbot, and the chatbot's responses will be sent back to the website via the API.
